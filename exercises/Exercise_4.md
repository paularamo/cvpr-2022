## Exercise 4: Quantize a Segmentation Model and Show Live Inference

_Goal_: Understand the NNCF funtionality. Post Training Quantization

_Notebook_: 

_Action_: 
Download this [pre-trained model](https://github.com/paularamo/cvpr-2022/blob/gh-pages/unet_kits19_state_dict.pth) and locate it into ```~/openvino_notebooks/notebooks/110-ct-segmentation-quantize/pretrained_model```

Run all cells and see the perfomance on your laptop.

### Task #4:

1. Change the device to GPU or MULTI.
2. Remember you should change the nncf_config.
3. Share with us your result using this Discussion thread, using Task # 4 and your name in the header message.
